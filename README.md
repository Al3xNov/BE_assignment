### ScraperService - will scrap and save data from webpage to db
---
> Implemented to scrape for "table" like wrappers, but left room for future improvement to scrape from URLs with query params, as I didn't have time to finish it. 

### ExchangeService - will retrive data from db

> A simple API to get results

## Db or File
---
Why save to Database instead of to file?

- More fault-tolerant and ACID
- Better scalability and queriability
- Allow Concurrency and relatively rapid response

***Disclaimer: due to time restriction the project is not finished but the blueprint is there, the code and architecture could be more abstract and reusable as well...***
